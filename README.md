# Messaging-Board

This message board allows multiple users to post their messages and view them in real-time. It meets the following requirements:

1. Users can type a message and post it to the message board.
2. Messages must be non-empty, and at most 128 characters long.
3. Users can see the messages from most to least recent.
4. Users on multiple devices can post on the same message board and view each other's messages.

Additional/Bonus Feature:
- Users can like other peoples' messages. They can only like a message once. 

Components:
The main component of this project is the "Add A Message" Button, which opens up a Modal popup and allows users to type and submit
their message to the message board. Another feature includes the "like" button, which allows users to like each other's messages. This project also
uses firebase db to store messages and allow users from multiple devices to view and interact with the same message board.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
